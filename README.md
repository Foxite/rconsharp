# rconsharp

rconsharp is a Valve RCON (https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_RCON_Protocol) protocol implementation for .NET written in C# as a Portable Class Library (PCL).
Due to the nature of PCLs it's not possible to have a common implementation of a network socket and due to this fact, a concrete class to handle network communication will be needed for each platform
